In this repo, I've included some sections of my work for my Le Wagon Data
Science final project. The code is the .py files is commented where I deemed
necessary, and the .ipynb files have some markdown before each section
describing what I was doing.

This project was done in a group consisting of myself, Afonso Froes, and Pedro
Peralta, Harpall Singh, and Marat Akhmetshin. Some sections present in this repo
were not coded by me, however I decided to include them as they lead to changes
in my code. The contibutions are always credited accordingly.
